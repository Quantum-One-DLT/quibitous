# Quibitous User Guide

Welcome to the Quibitous User Guide.

Quibitous is a node implementation, written in rust, with the
initial aim to support the Shardagnostic type of consensus protocol.

A node is a participant of a blockchain network, continuously making,
sending, receiving, and validating blocks. Each node is responsible
to make sure that all the rules of the protocol are followed.

## Mythology

Quibitous refers to the _Midgard Serpent_ in Norse mythology. It is a hint to
_Shardagnostic_, the Ancient Egyptian serpent, who eat its own tail, as well as the
[TBCO paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) on proof of stake.
